# Identifying-airline-passenger-satisfaction

Project Description

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to identify the factors that contribute to airline passengers' satisfaction. To accomplish this, we will be analyzing a dataset containing information about airline passengers' experiences, including flight details, passenger demographics, and ratings of various aspects of the flight experience. Our ultimate aim is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger was satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 129,880 rows and 24 columns, with each row representing a unique flight experience. The columns include information on flight details such as the airline, flight distance, and departure/arrival times, as well as passenger demographics such as age, gender, and type of travel (business or leisure). Additionally, the dataset includes ratings for various aspects of the flight experience, such as seat comfort, inflight entertainment, and onboard service.

Methodology
The project will use a variety of machine learning algorithms to identify the factors that contribute to passenger satisfaction. These algorithms will include:

Data preprocessing: 
Cleaning and transforming the dataset to prepare it for analysis
Exploratory data analysis: 
Visualizing and summarizing the dataset to identify patterns and relationships
Feature engineering: 
Creating new features from the existing dataset to improve model performance
Model training and selection: Testing various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for predicting passenger satisfaction
Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the chosen model using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall
Deliverables
The main deliverable of this project will be a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger was satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience. Additionally, we will provide a report detailing the methodology used in the project, as well as an analysis of the factors that contribute to passenger satisfaction. The report will include visualizations of the data, an explanation of the feature engineering process, and a discussion of the best-performing machine learning algorithm.

Future Work
Potential future work for this project could include:

Collecting additional data on passenger experiences to improve the accuracy of the model
Refining the feature engineering process to create more relevant and informative features
Implementing the model in a real-world scenario, such as an airline's customer service department, to provide insights into how to improve the passenger experience.
This machine learning project aims to identify the level of satisfaction of airline passengers based on their feedback. The dataset used in this project consists of various features such as the type of travel, the class of travel, the inflight service, the cleanliness, the ease of online booking, and so on. The target variable is the satisfaction level, which can be either "satisfied" or "unsatisfied."

Data Collection:

The data used in this project has been collected through online surveys conducted among airline passengers who have traveled in the last six months. The survey questions were designed to gather feedback on various aspects of airline travel, including the booking process, inflight experience, and overall satisfaction level.

Data Preprocessing:

The first step in any machine learning project is data preprocessing. This involves cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis. In this project, we will perform the following preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values: 
We will check if any missing values exist in the dataset and handle them accordingly.

Encoding categorical variables: 
The dataset contains several categorical variables, such as the type of travel and the class of travel. We will use one-hot encoding to convert these variables into numerical form.

Scaling numerical variables: 
We will scale the numerical variables in the dataset to ensure that they are on the same scale and have equal weightage in the analysis.

Model Building:

Once the data preprocessing is done, the next step is to build the machine learning model. In this project, we will use a classification model to predict the satisfaction level of airline passengers. We will try different models such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest and choose the best one based on their performance.

Model Evaluation:

After building the model, we need to evaluate its performance on the test set. We will use various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the model.

Deployment:

Once we have a model that performs well on the test set, we can deploy it in a real-world setting to predict the satisfaction level of airline passengers based on their feedback. We can integrate the model into an online survey system and provide real-time feedback to airlines to improve their services.

Conclusion:

This machine learning project aims to identify the satisfaction level of airline passengers based on their feedback. We will preprocess the data, build a classification model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it in a real-world setting. By doing so, we can help airlines improve their services and provide better customer satisfaction.
